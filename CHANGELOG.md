## v0.19.0
* **NOTE** - Due to the ZNG storage format change described in the
[`zq` v0.23.0 release notes](https://github.com/brimsec/zq/releases/tag/v0.23.0),
when you first launch the new version of Brim, a one-time bulk background
update of the stored data for all of your existing Spaces will automatically
begin. If you click to access a Space while migration is in progress, an
animated "spinner" will be visible in the right of the Search bar. Once
migration is complete for a Space, the bar chart will be filled in and the
first splash of events will be shown and you can begin working with your Space
as usual.
